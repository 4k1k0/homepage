# Homepage
Just a bunch of urls on a list, 3 weeaboo words and cute anime girls.

I made it "responsive" because I use i3wm and I open a lot of terminals when I'm browsing.

## Themes
The current themes are:

- arc-dark.css
- numix.css
- plasma5.css

If you want to change the default one you have to change the following line inside the html file:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/arc-dark.css" />
```

You are free to contribute with themes and suggestions.

## Configuration
You have to change the value of the 'files' variable in the script.js with the number of images in the img/ directory -this repo has only 5-. The images has to be ***png*** and their names has to be like this: 1.png 2.png, 3.png and please don't use 4K images... it's just a browser.

You can use the ***rename.sh*** script in order to rename your images in the img/ directory. Don't worry Windows user, you'll have Bash on your OS one of these days. 
```
$ bash rename.sh
```
## TODO
- [x] Improve the javascript.
- [x] Add themes.
- [ ] Change the themes using javascript (without delay).

I downloaded the images from [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_VmbVyD4eT3N1VUbGN4Wjd5OVE) I just resized them. Thanks 4chan!
If you want more images [/w/](https://boards.4chan.org/w/) is a good place to find images.
