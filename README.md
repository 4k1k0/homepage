# Homepage
Just a bunch of urls on a list, 3 weeaboo words and cute anime girls.

I made it "responsive" because I use i3wm and I open a lot of terminals when I'm browsing.

## Configuration
You have to change the value of the 'files' variable in the script.js with the number of files on your img directory.
The images has to be .png
And their names has to be like this: 1.png 2.png, 3.png
There is a bash script on the img directory to rename your images from the command line:
```

$ bash rename.sh
```
I downloaded the images from [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B_VmbVyD4eT3N1VUbGN4Wjd5OVE) I just resized them. Thanks 4chan!
